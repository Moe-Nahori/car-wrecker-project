### Git Workflow Guidelines
To maintain consistent development practices, follow these Git workflows in each session:

1. Starting Your Work Session:
   ```bash
   # Pull latest changes before starting work
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Creating Feature Branches:
   ```bash
   # Create and switch to a new feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

3. Making Changes:
   ```bash
   # Check status of your changes
   git status

   # Stage your changes
   git add .

   # Commit with clear message
   git commit -m "type: description"

   # Push changes
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   ```
