   - Added expandable/collapsible phases
   - Implemented progress bars in phase headers
   - Added overall statistics dashboard

### Important Notes
- Next.js is configured to use the root pages directory (frontend/pages) not src/pages
- All new pages should be created in frontend/pages
- API routes should be placed in frontend/pages/api
- This file location issue was causing changes not to be reflected in the served application

### Environment Details
- Frontend: Next.js 15.1.7 (Port 8001)
- Progress file path: PROJECT_PROGRESS.md
- Page location: frontend/pages/progress.js
- API routes: frontend/pages/api/*

- Progress tracking system is now fully functional with file system integration
- Real-time updates are working correctly
- Changes are properly persisted to the markdown file
- Page structure and location issues have been resolved
- System is ready for further feature additions

### Completed Tasks
1. Git Repository Setup
   - Initialized local Git repository
   - Created .gitignore file with proper configurations

   - Made initial commit with project files

2. GitHub Integration
   - Created new GitHub repository: car-wrecker-project
   - Connected local repository to GitHub
   - Successfully pushed initial codebase
   - Repository available at: https://github.com/Moe-Nahori/car-wrecker-project

### Git Workflow Guidelines
To maintain consistent development practices, follow these Git workflows in each session:

1. Starting Your Work Session:
   ```bash
   # Pull latest changes before starting work
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Creating Feature Branches:
   ```bash
   # Create and switch to a new feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

3. Making Changes:
   ```bash
   # Check status of your changes
   git status

   # Stage your changes
   git add .

   # Commit with clear message
   git commit -m "type: description"

   # Push changes
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   ```

4. Commit Message Types:
   - feat: New feature
   - fix: Bug fix
   - docs: Documentation changes
   - style: Formatting changes
   - refactor: Code restructuring
   - test: Adding tests
   - chore: Maintenance tasks

### Best Practices
1. Always pull before starting work each day
2. Create a new branch for each feature/fix
3. Make small, focused commits
4. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
5. Push changes regularly to avoid losing work
6. Keep feature branches short-lived
7. Request reviews for important changes
8. Merge only after testing

### Environment Details
- Repository URL: https://github.com/Moe-Nahori/car-wrecker-project
- Main branch: main
- Development workflow: Feature branch workflow
